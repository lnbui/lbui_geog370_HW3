<h1>GEOG370 Homework 3: Projections</h1>
<p>For this homework, I first downloaded data from the Natural Earth datasets, in particular the 1:50 raster with water, as well as the country and land boundary lines. After some adjustments to have all the countries be different colors using the layer styling tool to set the color ramp to random colors with the value being SOVEREIGNT, I simply adjusted the projections using CRS, and selecting for the ones that automatically adjusted.</p>
<img src="./projections/Mercator_Projection_4326.png" width="500px">
<p>This specific Mercator projection uses the WGS 84. also known as the Pseudo or Web Mercator, is the standard projection for online maps. It is a Mercator variant, and as such has similar virtues and flaws--it conserves the linear scale, and as such the angles and shapes, it distorts the size of objects, increasing in severity as latitude increases from equator to poles. What separates it from other Mercator variants is that it's a mix of both spherical and ellipsoid variants, which is easier to handle for small-scale maps such as the world, and also simpler to calculate.</p>
<img src="./projections/Behrmann_54017.png" width="500px">
<p>The Behrmann projection is a cylindrical map projection, differing from the other cylindrical equal-area projection by having its two standard parallels at 30 degrees North and 30 degrees South, between the two there is no distortion. While area is conserved, as it is an equal-area projection, many things are distorted in increasing intensity the further things are from the two parallels, including shape, direction, angle, and distance.</p>
<img src="./projections/Robinson_Projection_54030.png" width="500px">
<p>The Robinson Projection is a compromise map that attempts to show the entire world at once as a flat image. Neither equivalent nor conformal, distortion close to the poles is high due to the meridians being curved gently, but decreases the closer to the equator one goes. Nothing is conserved with this projeciton, distorting shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles, but while it does change longitudinally distortion is maintained in latitude. It's essentially a good attempt at showing the entire world at once, adhering to no one particular type to try to make the best of both worlds.</p>
<img src="./projections/Two-Point Equidistant Projection 54031.png" width="500px">
<p>A generalized version of the azimuthal equidistant projection, the Two-Point Equidistant projection has two locus points, distance which the two points to any other part of the map being correct. As an azimuthal projection, it preserves distance and direction, but it heavily distorts shapes. It's generally been used to map continents like Asia, where shape is not extraordinarily important in comparison to distance and direction. </p>
<img src="./projections/Gall Stereographic 54016.png" width="500px">
<p>A cylindrical projection, the Gall Stereographic projection is another compromise projeciton that seeks to neither preserve area or angles, attempting to keep the balance of distortion between both. Its standard parallels are 45 degrees north and south. Although it distorts shape, areas, distances, directions, and angles in general, it has the right scale and there si no distortion alongside the standard parallels, increasing away from them and maximizing at the poles. It's used for more general world maps that don't need fully accurate areas.</p>
<img src="./projections/Patterson 54079.png" width="500px">
<p>Another compromise cylindrical projection, the Patterson projection attempts to lessen exaggerated distortion at high latitude areas, such as near the poles. It preserves nothing, with distortion near minimal at the equator, but as with other compromise cylindrical projection, increases towards the poles.</p>
<img src="./projections/Sinusoidal_ 54008.png" width="500px">
<p>A pseudocylindrical equal-area projection, the sinusoidal projection it represents the poles as points, but heavily distorts the meridians and continents. The equator and prime meridian have no distortion, but the further from those lines one is, the greater the distortion, which includes shape, direction, angle, and distance, but scale remains true along every parallel and the central meridian. Although not generally recommended for use, it's usable for thematic world maps and for equatorial continents, which can have their own central meridians.</p>
<img src="./projections/Wagner V 54075.png" width="500px">
<p>The Wagner V projection is another compromise pseudocylindrical map, thus not preserving shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles. It's a fairly generic projection, with no essentially special quality rather than attempting to have a low-distortion appearance, thus being usable for general world maps.</p>
<img src="./projections/Van Der Grinter 54029.png" width="500px">
<p>Another compromise map, the Van der Grinten projection is neither conformal nor equal area. Although distortiong shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles, it is a polyconic projection, aiming to be circular, having the equator and central meridian appearing to be of equal length. Therefore, it generally preserves shapes akin to a Mercator projection, while attempting to reduce the Mercator's distortion, Naturally, however, polar regions are heavily distorted. It is highly used for global maps that don't require accurate areas,.</p>
