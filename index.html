<h1>GEOG370 Homework 3: Projections</h1>
<p>For this homework, I first downloaded data from the Natural Earth datasets, in particular the 1:50 raster with water, as well as the country and land boundary lines. After some adjustments to have all the countries be different colors using the layer styling tool to set the color ramp to random colors with the value being SOVEREIGNT, I simply adjusted the projections using CRS, and selecting for the ones that automatically adjusted.</p>

<p>This specific Mercator projection uses the WGS 84. also known as the Pseudo or Web Mercator, is the standard projection for online maps. It is a Mercator variant, and as such has similar virtues and flaws--it conserves the linear scale, and as such the angles and shapes, it distorts the size of objects, increasing in severity as latitude increases from equator to poles. What separates it from other Mercator variants is that it's a mix of both spherical and ellipsoid variants, which is easier to handle for small-scale maps such as the world, and also simpler to calculate.</p>
